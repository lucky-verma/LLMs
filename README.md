# NLP Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning various topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each folder represents a different NLP concept or technique, containing Jupyter notebooks, code examples, and resources related to that topic.

## Structure

- Each major topic has its own folder.
- Inside each folder:
  - Jupyter notebooks with code examples and explanations.
  - A README.md file summarizing key points and resources.
